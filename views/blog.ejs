            <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
            mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell
            who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the
            hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've
            known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids.
            They called me Mr Glass.</p>
